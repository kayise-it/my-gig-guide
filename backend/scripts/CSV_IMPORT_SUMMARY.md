## Scripts Created

### 1. `import_venues_csv_fixed.js`
- First working version that successfully imported 293 venues
- Manual CSV parsing to handle semicolon-separated format
- Basic coordinate parsing

### 2. `import_venues_final.js`
- Improved version with better coordinate parsing
- Enhanced location detection
- More detailed reporting

### 3. `test_csv_structure.js`
- Testing script to validate CSV structure
- Analyzes data quality and format

### 4. `debug_csv.js`
- Debug script to examine raw CSV content
- Helps understand file structure

## Database Schema
Venues were imported with the following structure:
- **name**: Venue name (required)
- **address**: Physical address
- **phone_number**: Contact phone
- **contact_email**: Email address
- **website**: Website URL
- **latitude/longitude**: GPS coordinates
- **location**: Auto-detected area (Pretoria, Johannesburg, etc.)
- **capacity**: Default 100 (can be updated later)
- **owner_id**: Links to organiser
- **owner_type**: Set to 'organiser'
- **userId**: Links to user account

## Usage Instructions

### To run the import:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/import_venues_final.js
```

### To test CSV structure:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/test_csv_structure.js
```

## Notes
- The script automatically skips venues that already exist (by name)
- Coordinates are parsed from the "LatLong" column in format "lat, lng"
- Location is automatically determined based on coordinate boundaries
- Default capacity is set to 100 for all venues
- All venues are assigned to the first available organiser in the system

## Next Steps
1. Review and update venue capacities based on actual venue sizes
2. Add venue descriptions from the CSV data if needed
3. Upload venue images to the file system
4. Verify venue data accuracy and completeness
5. Consider adding social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) if needed

- `backend/scripts/test_csv_structure.js`
- `backend/scripts/debug_csv.js`
- `backend/scripts/CSV_IMPORT_SUMMARY.md`

## Dependencies Added
- `csv-parser` package for CSV parsing (though manual parsing was used in final version)
